## Ways to Make Progress

### 1. Completing Checkpoints

Checkpoints are the primary unit of progress within guides. There are three types:

| Type | Description | How to Complete |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tasks** | One-time actions | Complete once and check off |
| **Skills** | Abilities that take time to develop | Mark as started, then completed when consolidated |
| **Habits** | Long-term practices requiring regular reflection | Mark as started, ongoing reflection, completed when established |

**Example tasks:**
- Read a section of a book (7-8 minutes of content)
- Set up a sacred prayer space
- Make a solemn commitment

### 2. Making Comments

Comments are a primary way to provide feedback on documents.

**How:**
- Laptop: Highlight text, click the comment icon on the right
- Phone: Turn on edit mode (pencil icon), highlight text, tap three dots, select "add comment"

**Where to comment:**
- Master documents for guides
- Introduction guides
- Spiritual Disciplines Map
- Any document in the system

### 3. Making Suggestions

Suggestions are proposed edits tracked separately from direct changes.

**How:**
- Laptop: Click bottom icon to turn on suggestion mode, make edits, turn off suggestion mode
- Phone: Click three dots (top right), turn on "Suggest changes", make edits, turn off suggestion mode

**Use cases:**
- Improving prose and clarity
- Fixing errors
- Proposing better wording

### 4. Completing Surveys

Surveys provide anonymous feedback opportunities.

**Types:**

### 5. Reporting Errors

When you find issues in the system, report them.

**How:** Use the AVC Error Report Form to log:
- System bugs
- Content errors

### 6. Proofreading

Writers Guild members can proofread documents for:
- Spelling
- Grammar
- Style consistency

**Documents available for proofreading:**
- Introduction Guide
- Into the Deep Guide

### 7. Writing New Guides

Create new spiritual formation guides following the writing guidelines:

1. Extract practical steps from source material
2. Break content into 7-8 minute segments
3. Create checkboxes for accountability
4. Include tasks, skills, and habits appropriately

### 8. Mentoring Others

Trialing Guild members can become mentors:

1. Complete the mentor application
2. Invite others to use the Narrow Way App
3. Guide them through resources
4. Track their progress via Group Progress documents

### 9. Testing/Trialing

Active testing helps improve the system:

- Complete the testing application
- Work through guides personally
- Document your experience
- Provide structured feedback

### 10. Contributing to Functionality and Design

**Functionality suggestions:**
- Propose new features
- Suggest workflow improvements
- Recommend accountability mechanisms

**Design contributions:**
- Create UI mockups (using Figma or paper sketches)
- Review existing designs
- Compare with other apps (e.g., Holy Habits)

### 11. Prayer Intercession (Prayer Guild)

Progress through prayer support:
- Pray for the project daily

## Progress Tracking

### Personal Progress
- Each guide has a checkpoint list to track your journey
- Group Progress documents show shared accountability
- Daily automated messages (SMS/email) encourage consistency

### The 30-Day Principle
Consistent effort over 30 days helps establish new habits. The first month is typically the hardest, but persistence pays off.

### Consolidation Before Progression
Skills and habits should be consolidated (practiced consistently) before moving to the next module. This ensures genuine growth rather than superficial completion.

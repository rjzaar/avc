&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostolic projects can consume excessive amounts of time and energy. This project is different. For starters our first concern is the health of your soul. We really want you to grow in holiness through this effort. If there is something else that you should be doing (like duties of state in life) rather than working on this project, then please do it! We are so serious about this that we &amp;nbsp;have embedded an examen into the project workflow which should be prayed through before any related activity. Let&amp;rsquo;s pray that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Narrow Way Prayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Lord Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the Way, the Truth and the Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please give me clarity in discernment and empower me to do Your Will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for the gift of prayer and spiritual formation through which I grow in intimacy with you and yield to take the narrow way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for my spouse/and children/bishop/superior through whose service I grow closer to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for my work where love builds a bridge for truth to cross and order the world according to your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for Apostoli Viae where we live, light and lead the way to union with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for all the other aspects of my life,through prudence and diligence your grace flows, so you may be with, in and through all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is my life so ordered that I am now ready to work on the Narrow Way Project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{Take a minute of silent recollection to discern}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the full examen here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/13I_ZUh764qLfIrNRIAx8YfEkmOT8RwINlRKrjYvAO0E/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646524027&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0S-5VOSC3NL8nOtxxd6yml&quot;&gt;AV Commons Examen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you need to hug your wife, or play with your kids go for it. If there is some other task that you should be doing, particularly anything to do with your spiritual life and the vocation for which the Lord has called you, then please stop reading this and do what you should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still here? Ok, down to business, prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo; If the LORD does not build the house, in vain do its builders labor.&amp;rdquo; (Psalm 127:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now going to attempt to lead you to a paradigm shift. Those who are first in any new venture set the lasting culture (ethos) of that venture. We want to make sure we get this right from the start and so we are going to offer some well-spent energy to provide extra detail for this important effort. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/15vYsDkTyq81iW5udTJ8F8rDYb_0Yc9ysBccRf7FRqN0/edit&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646525605&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1zc5qiRs7ox4Ro-YzdTLY4&quot;&gt;contents of this email&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is part of the Narrow Way Project (so you can refer to it any time you like). &amp;nbsp;Fr Jeffrey Kirby in From Sojourner to Disciple lamented the loss of young people from the Church after confirmation and how to &amp;lsquo;lessen such a tide&amp;rsquo; he wrote, &amp;ldquo;In large part, observation teaches us that the singular greatest response we can give is to guide young people to form a personal relationship with Jesus. Nothing else compares.&amp;rdquo; (p.141). From another perspective, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_en.html&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646526217&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2C8pv4UQOVc3GHbrpZZ0Vu&quot;&gt;Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(CSDC) which is a synthesis of all of Catholic Social Teaching containing the wisdom of the Church for ordering human society according to God&amp;rsquo;s plan says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As for &amp;ldquo;the social question&amp;rdquo;, we must not be seduced by &amp;ldquo;the naive expectation that, faced with the great challenges of our time, we shall find some magic formula. No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person and the assurance that He gives us: I am with you! It is not therefore a matter of inventing a &amp;lsquo;new programme&amp;#39;. The programme already exists: it is the plan found in the Gospel and in the living Tradition, it is the same as ever. Ultimately, it has its centre in Christ himself, who is to be known, loved and imitated, so that in him we may live the life of the Trinity, and with him transform history until its fulfilment in the heavenly Jerusalem&amp;rdquo;[1213].&amp;quot; (CSDC 577)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Lord Jesus, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray that you guide all we do in the Narrow Way Project so it may be where people encounter you, love you and imitate you. May we in all we do in this project know you, love you and imitate you. I ask this through the intercession of St John of the Cross, St Teresa of Avila, St Peter, St Paul, St Thomas Aquinas and Blessed Carlo Acutis in your name Lord Jesus. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave&amp;mdash; just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 20:25-28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Freely you have received, freely give.&amp;rdquo; (Matt 10:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All for one and one for all&amp;rdquo; (The Three Musketeers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the whole project is under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646527687&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3yrr5Or5REM2fbM6CHJwfo&quot;&gt;public domain license&lt;/a&gt;, you literally, in a way, own it all. It is all for you to do with as you please. So if you like, you can lead the whole project (and I can relax on Dan&amp;rsquo;s porch drinking Pina Coladas). If you have the skill, the time and the holiness to do that, I would be very happy to hand it over to you. I am setting this up so everyone gets the chance to contribute any way they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that this project unfold at the pace of prayer. You are free to come and go from the project as you like. The system is designed so you can jump in, do a bit and jump out. Practically, you can check your group&amp;rsquo;s dashboard, take up a task, complete it in whatever it takes, eg 20 minutes, push that resource to the next person and you are done. Or if you have capacity you could propose a whole new way of doing things. Every contribution is welcomed, big or small. The most powerful and important being prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many Catholic initiatives where people are giving copious hours to ministry, but are not developing their own spiritual life. They don&amp;rsquo;t have a mental prayer life. There is much energy and anxiety spent on organizing, working, fighting for what is right. There is a shift from the human efforts of early purgative to the divinely led late purgative. From being a consumer of the culture of death to becoming a producer of the culture of life (from Netflix to AV Commons). Jesus is the one who guides and empowers this progress in those who, in a rightly ordered way, give themselves to His service. Through His grace they serve each other. It is a symphony of grace. Divine creativity blossoms in superabundant effectiveness. The King is building His Kingdom of love, life and joy. Servant of God &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://catholicexchange.com/the-surrender-novena-let-jesus-take-care-of-everything/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646528712&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2xizdpfuDk90eZ3O3BuY4T&quot;&gt;Don Dolindo put it well&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;You are not sick people who ask the doctor to cure you, but rather sick people who tell the doctor how to.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;You do not turn to Me, instead, you want Me to adapt to your&amp;nbsp;ideas.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we work His way? That&amp;rsquo;s why we have the examen before we start and discern every new project. God gives inspirations to the least likely (cf Matt 11:25). We want to capture all these inspirations and weave them into the project. All the resources are open for comment for anyone to contribute their wisdom. What about conflicts? In short, those involved discern together with the proximate leadership demarcating and if needed cascading up leadership levels until solved. It is the structure of AV that encourages progress in the spiritual life that makes this all possible, ie having sufficient numbers of those involved docile to the Holy Spirit. In summary, we are free to do our bit in service at the pace of prayer for God&amp;rsquo;s greater glory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While someone involved in AV Commons should have a daily mental prayer life and daily examen, you could still help us to help you to establish these basic routines by joining our trialing group. Our first spiritual formation resources are ready to be tested. If you want to develop a daily mental prayer life then you are the perfect person to provide feedback on these resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick clarifiers. The whole project is called the&amp;nbsp;Narrow Way Project&amp;nbsp;which will eventually create &amp;lsquo;The Narrow Way App&amp;rsquo; which will be accessible on any phone or laptop. For now a prototype has been created also called &amp;lsquo;the Narrow Way app&amp;rsquo; which is a google sheet that can send texts with links to spiritual formation resources. Currently there is only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RzRhB_VZ6BLm5d7n66q3QsfU6asa3Md1rQuHvyPcF5k/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646530092&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0-rvT3TeM_HmJM4ptL0z8t&quot;&gt;an introductory guide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbNad_Lo6_lrlGbkVnRmZ63bC0ilRFAIFPj0sdh3PvU/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646530539&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2bpaa3V_LnVTMm-sokUHWq&quot;&gt;a guide to Into the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. The next guide to write is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/12HLMs-Z-RqmAo9n35jIzaMVsP_yrATlzdC1Ec56m2mM/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646531008&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw154PiZsISR8vH2WG7WthRa&quot;&gt;Spiritual Warfare and the Discernment of Spirits&lt;/a&gt;. So we need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;c6 lst-kix_i4pt163uemst-0 start&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;Writers to write the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/12HLMs-Z-RqmAo9n35jIzaMVsP_yrATlzdC1Ec56m2mM/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646531558&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1OLAngc1enHtjSXl5Zipgj&quot;&gt;SWDOS &lt;/a&gt;guide and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;We also want help &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTNeSvLPK9zM5XqMuCnx1_JeaSm596FdVkDy_mqXJpw/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646532091&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw08Idwy8KElfw6sMIDaLhO0&quot;&gt;mapping out a complete spiritual formation program&lt;/a&gt;. So we want anyone with any expertise to make suggestions and improve what we have so far. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be many questions and discussions - so let&amp;#39;s have them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how are we going to organize all the skills, people and ideas? That is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Pb-7U4tARsL-wtVuFU66cDywnT-Mhsw6tuIyP9NAX0/edit&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646532879&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3qLCpAepA9THQ3AXo-hWzI&quot;&gt;AV Commons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;comes in. It also is a prototype of a more robust content management system that will need to be created. AV Commons is currently a google sheet that runs a flexible workflow system (It has a lot of Google code that Rob Zaar wrote to make it work). It is operational, so we can start to use it now. It needs use to be improved. So please make suggestions of how it can be improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;c6 lst-kix_yi1vw2snzfaj-0 start&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;Every member will get their own dashboard which will list any assets that need work according to any group that person is part of. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;There are also group dashboards where groups can organize themselves and group members can take on group tasks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;We will also have new groups on the AV website for each group, eg &amp;lsquo;NWP Writers&amp;rsquo; for the Writer&amp;rsquo;s group. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both The Narrow Way App and AV Commons is operational and ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we going to work on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testers will start using the Narrow Way app to test the resources. Writers will review all documents and help make them clearer and can start writing new ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;c6 lst-kix_23az2pvdymz-0 start&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;Those already with spiritual formation (Spiritual Directors, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you) can help improve the formation map. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;Those with a teaching background, the pedagogy group, will look at how to improve the way the Narrow Way app works, its design, features, etc. They could also look at what&amp;rsquo;s written and the guides and start with suggestions of how to improve them. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;Coders can help with the two Google sheets (javascript) and developing the specifications for the final solution and what technologies to use (React Native? Nextjs? Drupal?) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;Video editors can start by creating a master list of all videos, creating transcripts, cataloging them and using the transcripts with some code/tool (looking at the coders for help) to auto create key words so they can be easily searched. As Crystal Gordan suggested, &amp;ldquo;I hope it involves keywords to things Dan has talked about, to make things we remember him saying but can&amp;#39;t remember which video, easier to search and find.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c2 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;There are other tasks that can be found once you are in the system. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going to attack this thing from every angle until it&amp;rsquo;s out the door. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll keep improving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to join AV Commons. We have another form for you to fill in which is the doorway into AV Commons. There is some extra information we need to help get this project going. It also means we can be absolutely sure you are happy to agree with your contribution being public domain. This is also one of the aspects which makes this project different. We are giving it all away for free. &amp;ldquo;Freely you have received, freely give&amp;rdquo; (Matt 10:8). The final product will be attribution free and free for anyone to do anything they like with it. All for one and one for all. We want to renew the whole world with quality spiritual formation. If that means someone sells it. Praise God. If that means someone uses it in their own community. Praise God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are invited to fill out the AV Commons form: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnY_S6vHdb01UXPOrEhxWn_MSlelorzliZCZjLNu2RMfYYLw/viewform?usp%3Dsf_link&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1722080646535353&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1vD7XVusYxHrSbz6aoNdfl&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnY_S6vHdb01UXPOrEhxWn_MSlelorzliZCZjLNu2RMfYYLw/viewform?usp=sf_link&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for your time. That was a lot of information. It is a big project but can be done bit by bit. My aim is to get you up to speed with the least convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unum Necessarium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Bless&lt;/p&gt;

Dear [name],
Welcome to the Narrow Way Project!
Apostolic projects can consume excessive amounts of time and energy. This project is different. For starters our first concern is the health of your soul. We really want you to grow in holiness through this effort. If there is something else that you should be doing (like duties of state in life) rather than working on this project, then please do it! We are so serious about this that we have embedded an examen into the project workflow which should be prayed through before any related activity. Let’s pray that now.
The Narrow Way Prayer
Dear Lord Jesus,
You are the Way, the Truth and the Life.
Please give me clarity in discernment and empower me to do Your Will.
Thank-you for the gift of prayer and spiritual formation through which I grow in intimacy with you and yield to take the narrow way.
Thank-you for my spouse/and children/bishop/superior through whose service I grow closer to you.
Thank-you for my work where love builds a bridge for truth to cross and order the world according to your plan.
Thank-you for Apostoli Viae where we live, light and lead the way to union with you.
Thank-you for all the other aspects of my life,through prudence and diligence your grace flows, so you may be with, in and through all.
Is my life so ordered that I am now ready to work on the Narrow Way Project?
{Take a minute of silent recollection to discern}
Amen.
You can read the full examen here, AV Commons Examen.
So if you need to hug your wife, or play with your kids go for it. If there is some other task that you should be doing, particularly anything to do with your spiritual life and the vocation for which the Lord has called you, then please stop reading this and do what you should be doing.
Still here? Ok, down to business, prayer.
“ If the LORD does not build the house, in vain do its builders labor.” (Psalm 127:1)
We are now going to attempt to lead you to a paradigm shift. Those who are first in any new venture set the lasting culture (ethos) of that venture. We want to make sure we get this right from the start and so we are going to offer some well-spent energy to provide extra detail for this important effort. The contents of this email is part of the Narrow Way Project (so you can refer to it any time you like). Fr Jeffrey Kirby in From Sojourner to Disciple lamented the loss of young people from the Church after confirmation and how to ‘lessen such a tide’ he wrote, “In large part, observation teaches us that the singular greatest response we can give is to guide young people to form a personal relationship with Jesus. Nothing else compares.” (p.141). From another perspective, the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church (CSDC) which is a synthesis of all of Catholic Social Teaching containing the wisdom of the Church for ordering human society according to God’s plan says this:
“As for “the social question”, we must not be seduced by “the naive expectation that, faced with the great challenges of our time, we shall find some magic formula. No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person and the assurance that He gives us: I am with you! It is not therefore a matter of inventing a ‘new programme'. The programme already exists: it is the plan found in the Gospel and in the living Tradition, it is the same as ever. Ultimately, it has its centre in Christ himself, who is to be known, loved and imitated, so that in him we may live the life of the Trinity, and with him transform history until its fulfilment in the heavenly Jerusalem”[1213].&quot; (CSDC 577)
Dear Lord Jesus, 
I pray that you guide all we do in the Narrow Way Project so it may be where people encounter you, love you and imitate you. May we in all we do in this project know you, love you and imitate you. I ask this through the intercession of St John of the Cross, St Teresa of Avila, St Peter, St Paul, St Thomas Aquinas and Blessed Carlo Acutis in your name Lord Jesus. Amen.
“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” (Matt 20:25-28)
“Freely you have received, freely give.” (Matt 10:8)

Since the whole project is under a public domain license, you literally, in a way, own it all. It is all for you to do with as you please. So if you like, you can lead the whole project (and I can relax on Dan’s porch drinking Pina Coladas). If you have the skill, the time and the holiness to do that, I would be very happy to hand it over to you. I am setting this up so everyone gets the chance to contribute any way they like. 
It is important that this project unfold at the pace of prayer. You are free to come and go from the project as you like. The system is designed so you can jump in, do a bit and jump out.

For now a prototype has been created also called ‘the Narrow Way app’ which is a google sheet that can send texts with links to spiritual formation resources. Currently there is only an introductory guide and a guide to Into the Deep. The next guide to write is on Spiritual Warfare and the Discernment of Spirits. So we need
Writers to write the SWDOS guide and more. 
We also want help mapping out a complete spiritual formation program. So we want anyone with any expertise to make suggestions and improve what we have so far. 
There will be many questions and discussions - so let's have them. 
But how are we going to organize all the skills, people and ideas? That is where AV Commons comes in. It also is a prototype of a more robust content management system that will need to be created. AV Commons is currently a google sheet that runs a flexible workflow system (It has a lot of Google code that Rob Zaar wrote to make it work). It is operational, so we can start to use it now. It needs use to be improved. So please make suggestions of how it can be improved. 
Every member will get their own dashboard which will list any assets that need work according to any group that person is part of. 
There are also group dashboards where groups can organize themselves and group members can take on group tasks. 
We will also have new groups on the AV website for each group, eg ‘NWP Writers’ for the Writer’s group. 
Both The Narrow Way App and AV Commons is operational and ready for use.
So what are we going to work on? 
Testers will start using the Narrow Way app to test the resources. Writers will review all documents and help make them clearer and can start writing new ones. 
Those already with spiritual formation (Spiritual Directors, I’m looking at you) can help improve the formation map. 
Those with a teaching background, the pedagogy group, will look at how to improve the way the Narrow Way app works, its design, features, etc. They could also look at what’s written and the guides and start with suggestions of how to improve them. 
Coders can help with the two Google sheets (javascript) and developing the specifications for the final solution and what technologies to use (React Native? Nextjs? Drupal?) 
Video editors can start by creating a master list of all videos, creating transcripts, cataloging them and using the transcripts with some code/tool (looking at the coders for help) to auto create key words so they can be easily searched. As Crystal Gordan suggested, “I hope it involves keywords to things Dan has talked about, to make things we remember him saying but can't remember which video, easier to search and find.”
There are other tasks that can be found once you are in the system. 
We are going to attack this thing from every angle until it’s out the door. Then we’ll keep improving it.
The next step is to join AV Commons. We have another form for you to fill in which is the doorway into AV Commons. There is some extra information we need to help get this project going. It also means we can be absolutely sure you are happy to agree with your contribution being public domain. This is also one of the aspects which makes this project different. We are giving it all away for free. “Freely you have received, freely give” (Matt 10:8). The final product will be attribution free and free for anyone to do anything they like with it. All for one and one for all. We want to renew the whole world with quality spiritual formation. If that means someone sells it. Praise God. If that means someone uses it in their own community. Praise God.
You are invited to fill out the AV Commons form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnY_S6vHdb01UXPOrEhxWn_MSlelorzliZCZjLNu2RMfYYLw/viewform?usp=sf_link 
Thank-you for your time. That was a lot of information. It is a big project but can be done bit by bit. My aim is to get you up to speed with the least convenience. 
Unum Necessarium
God Bless

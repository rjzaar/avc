# Guild Skill Systems Research

Research on how specific skills and levels work in guild systems, including confirmation/certification at each level.

## Historical Guild Model: Apprentice → Journeyman → Master

The traditional three-tier system from medieval European guilds:

| Level | Duration | Confirmation Method |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **Apprentice** | 3-7 years | Work under master, imitation and practice |
| **Journeyman** | Variable | Judged "skilled enough" by master, allowed to travel |
| **Master** | Lifetime | Submit a "masterpiece" to guild for evaluation |

Key insight: Only masters could take on apprentices and run businesses. Many spent their entire lives as journeymen.

## Modern Trade Systems

### Germany's Meister System

Germany retains the formal three-tier system with state certification:

- **Lehrling** (Apprentice) → **Geselle** (Journeyman) → **Meister** (Master)
- The **Meisterbrief** certification is equivalent to a bachelor's degree
- Required for safety-critical trades (electricians, chimney sweeps)
- Includes theoretical, practical, business, and legal training

### UK City & Guilds

City & Guilds offers industry-recognized qualifications through employer-sponsored apprenticeships with formal certification at each level.

## Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition

A well-researched five-stage framework applicable to any skill:

| Stage | Characteristics | Decision Making |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **1. Novice** | Follows rules rigidly, needs step-by-step instructions | Analytical only |
| **2. Advanced Beginner** | Recognizes patterns, adapts rules to situations | Limited situational |
| **3. Competent** | Organizes information, makes deliberate plans | Conscious, goal-oriented |
| **4. Proficient** | Intuitive perspective, develops own rules | Intuition + analysis |
| **5. Expert** | Fluid, unconscious performance | Pure intuition |

**Confirmation approach**: Observation of behavior patterns, not just knowledge tests. Experts "do what normally works" without conscious deliberation.

### Key Progression Concept

As the student becomes skilled, they depend less on abstract principles and more on concrete experience. An over-reliance on the conscious application of rules and procedures leads a learner to stall at the stage of competence and prevents intuitive perspectives from emerging.

## Martial Arts Belt Systems

Belt ranking provides a clear visual progression model:

### Typical Progression

White → Yellow → Orange → Green → Blue → Purple → Brown → Black

### Dan Ranks (Black Belt Levels)

1st Dan through 10th Dan, with increasing years required between each level:
- 1st to 2nd Dan: 2-3 years
- 2nd to 3rd Dan: 2-3 years
- 3rd to 4th Dan: 3-4 years
- Continuing pattern of increasing time requirements

### Confirmation Criteria (Holistic Evaluation)

## Key Patterns for Skill Confirmation

Based on these examples, effective confirmation systems share:

1. **Multi-source assessment** - Not just one evaluator
2. **Demonstration of work** - Masterpiece, capstone project, sparring
3. **Time minimums** - Prevent premature advancement
4. **Scope expansion** - Each level impacts larger domain
5. **Peer recognition** - Other practitioners validate level
6. **Observable behaviors** - Not just knowledge, but application
7. **Calibration** - Ensure consistent standards across evaluators
8. **Clear criteria** - Published expectations for each level

---

## Application Considerations

When designing a guild skill system, consider:

### Structure Questions
- How many levels are appropriate for the skill domain?
- What is the expected time at each level?
- Who can confirm advancement? (Self, peer, master, committee)
- What evidence is required? (Portfolio, demonstration, examination)

### Progression Models
- **Linear**: Each level builds on previous (martial arts)
- **Branching**: Specialize after reaching a threshold (trade guilds)
- **Scope-based**: Advancement = wider impact (Spotify model)
- **Competency-based**: Meet criteria regardless of time (certifications)

### Confirmation Mechanisms
- **Examination**: Written or practical tests
- **Portfolio review**: Collection of work products
- **Peer assessment**: Other practitioners evaluate
- **Master approval**: Senior practitioner confirms readiness
- **Committee decision**: Multiple evaluators deliberate
- **Time-served**: Minimum duration requirements

| **Distinguished** | — | Writes persuasively; tailors language to audience; near-native sophistication |

### Academic Rubric Levels

Common proficiency descriptors used in educational settings:

| Level | Alternative Labels | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Beginning** | Novice, Emerging, Poor | Basic understanding, relies heavily on templates |
| **Developing** | Progressing, Fair | Shows growth, needs guidance |
| **Competent** | Proficient, Good | Meets expectations independently |
| **Advanced** | Exemplary, Excellent | Exceeds expectations, sophisticated work |

## Writer Development Stages

### Dean Wesley Smith's Four-Stage Model

A commercial fiction-focused progression:

| Stage | Characteristics | Confirmation |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Stage 1** | Beginning writer, learning basics, often in a hurry | Time and practice |
| **Stage 2** | Developing craft, starting to understand market | Completed manuscripts |
| **Stage 3** | Consistent output, understanding business | Sales, agent/editor interest |
| **Stage 4** | Professional, sustainable career | Ongoing publication, income |

Key insight: "No matter how much a beginning writer wants to get lucky and hit with top-selling books, the skill level doesn't jump ahead. All writers go through the stages."

### Amateur vs. Professional Distinctions

| Amateur | Professional |
|---------|--------------|
| Sees writing as only art | Understands writing as art AND publishing as business |
| Struggles to separate creative and commercial | Treats book as product when engaging industry |
| Views completion as the goal | Views revision as core work (more time rewriting than writing) |
| Learns occasionally | Continuously invests in development |
| Hobby approach | Business approach with priorities |

### The Writers Studio Level System

A structured curriculum approach:

1. **Level I**: Moving from stream-of-consciousness to conscious crafting for audience
2. **Level II**: Developing personal voice while maintaining craft
3. **Level III**: Advanced techniques, genre mastery
4. **Level IV**: Professional-level work, portfolio development

# Theological Skills

## Overview of Theological Competencies

Theological education focuses on formation—developing the whole person for ministry. The United States Catholic Bishops identify four dimensions of formation:

1. **Intellectual Formation** - Knowledge of Scripture, tradition, theology
2. **Pastoral Formation** - Skills for ministry practice
3. **Human Formation** - Personal maturity, self-awareness
4. **Spiritual Formation** - Prayer, discernment, relationship with God

### Three-Dimensional Framework

Many seminaries use a "Head, Heart, Hands" model:

| Dimension | Focus | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Head** (Knowledge) | What you know | Scripture, doctrine, history, languages |
| **Heart** (Character) | Who you are | Spiritual maturity, integrity, self-awareness |
| **Hands** (Skill) | What you can do | Preaching, counseling, leadership, administration |

# Summary: Cross-Domain Patterns

Across all skill domains (trades, software, writing, theology), effective guild-style systems share these elements:

## Universal Skill Level Framework

| Level | Characteristics | Confirmation |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Novice/Beginner** | Follows rules, needs instruction | Supervisor observation |
| **Apprentice/Developing** | Applies learning, needs guidance | Mentor assessment |
| **Journeyman/Competent** | Works independently, consistent quality | Work product review |
| **Senior/Proficient** | Handles complexity, intuitive judgment | Peer recognition |
| **Master/Expert** | Sets standards, teaches others | Community acknowledgment |

## Key Design Principles

1. **Clear criteria** at each level
2. **Multiple assessment methods** (not just tests)
3. **Time in practice** requirements
4. **Demonstration of work** (masterpiece, portfolio, sermon)
5. **Mentorship relationship** throughout
6. **Community validation** (guild, denomination, profession)
7. **Increasing scope** of responsibility and impact
8. **Continuous learning** expectation even at highest levels
